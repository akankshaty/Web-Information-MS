Login "Wrong password" error:

Since student_signup.php puts in hashed password into the login_info table instead of the text password, password '123' won't be stored as '123' but the hash of it will be stored. 

In student_signup.php, password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT) will save the hashed password of the password entered in the signup form into the database.
In index.php, password_verify($password, $row['password']) will compare the password entered in the login form ($password) and the stored password from the 'password' column of login_info table ($row['password']).

So update the table 'password' entries for successful login of existing verified users:

1. Get the hashed password of existing passwords - go to any online php editor and type in these lines:
$pass = '123'; # or whatever is the password entered in the table for that user. Assuming '123' is the password.
echo password_hash($pass, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);

2. Copy the output and update the login_info table to paste in the hashed password.

3. Hit enter in the URL bar of the home page in case you have the website already running. Refresh button may not work.
